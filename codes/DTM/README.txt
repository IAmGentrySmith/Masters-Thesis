Welcome to the Dihedral Torsion Minimizer, Version 0.2!

This is still a work in progress and is considered pre-alpha release.

Setup:
This tool is best utilized at Oklahoma State University on the Cowboy cluster. It has been designed specifically
for that cluster's infrastructure. Future versions should work to abstract out the jobs to include additional systems.

To run the minimizer, simply run the Runner.py file in a terminal on the Cowboy. Make sure every file in this folder
is together and that Runner.py is run when in the same folder as all these (or alter your /bin to make each of
these executable).

Background:
This project was conceived in Fall 2016 when Dr. Scott Weinert needed help geometrically minimizing a bulky
Germanium molecule and went to Dr. Chris Fennell. Feeling this would be a great opportunity for a learning experience,
Dr. Fennell asked one of his new graduate students, Gentry Smith, to learn how to use Cowboy to find the lowest
conformation.

Like many before him, Gentry was unable to find the lowest energy conformation, continually receiving nonsensical
values. After consulting the findings with Dr. Fennell, it was suggested that Gentry build a tool to progressively
search and find the lowest conformation. This tool is the product of that work.
