\section{States and Properties of Ice}

Ice is cool. 


\subsection{Bernal-Fowler Ice Rules}



\subsection{Forms of Ice}

While ubiquitous in the 'I$_{h}$' form, ice water has many known forms.
As of the writing of this work, there are 17 established forms of ice. 
These forms usually occur in cubic, hexagonal, and orthorhombic crystal structures.
The relationship between external pressure and temperature are the primary defining characteristics of which form will form in a given system. 
Do other characteristics come into play??????? %FIND OUT


\subsection{Ice I$_{h}$}

As the most commonly found form on earth, ice I$_{h}$ is a highly desired form for computational studies involving ice systems. 


\subsection{Efforts to Generate Ice I$_{h}$}

\subsection{Comparison between Ice XI and Ice I$_{h}$}

While ice I$_{h}$ is known as the most common form of ice found on the planet, it is much more difficult to computationally generate than an ice XI lattice. 
The ease of generation of an ice XI structure stems from the repetition of a unit cell with consistent layering and orientation throughout the crystal lattice. 
All protons and lone pairs are ordered in a consistent manner that produce proper hydrogen bonds. 
Lattice defects, defined as an ordering in which two protons  or oxygen atoms are "pointed" toward one another instead of a proton-oxygen pairing, results in an increase of the residual entropy and general instability of the ice XI crystal. 
These lattice defects do not commonly arise in the computational structure without running a simulation with sufficient free energy to perturb the system.

With ice I$_{h}$ crystals, the proton-disordered form introduces entropy by way of rotational disorder. 
As the protons and lone pairs are no longer consistently ordered, hydrogen bonds may no longer form properly at all interaction sites. 
The interaction of proton with proton or lone pair with lone pair are not hydrogen bonds and are considered defects in the lattice. 
An ice structure of randomly oriented molecules without consideration of hydrogen bonds will likely produce defects at many interaction sites across the lattice and weaken the integrity of the system, leading to stability problems while running simulations. 
In generating the crystal, the cause of these defects must be considered and countered effectively.
